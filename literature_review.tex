\section{Literature Review}
    \note{
        This should be derived from the literature review report. It will likely have been updated throughout the year, including additional information of relevance arising through project completion and supervisor feedback. It will detail the knowledge gained of subject fundamentals and offer evidence to demonstrate that you have achieved a foundation of knowledge in your chosen subject area. Concepts, theories and opinions need to be critically evaluated and the reasons for application of the concepts and their relevance to the solution of the problem need to be established.
