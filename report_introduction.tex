\section{Report Introduction}
    \note{Here you will state what the report is about. This is about the literature review and methods, NOT the project as a whole. Do not begin with 'This project…' but rather, 'This report…'. Provide context, similar to the proposal rationale, in that you will say what you intend to do and why. Provide a clear structure of your report. This should not be very long and should provide a roadmap of what is included in the remainder of the report.}

    \subsection{Aim and Objectives}
        \note{Update your aim and objectives of the project with modifications generated from the feedback as provided by your supervisor. List objectives with modifications if applicable and agreed with your supervisor. Objectives should be SMART and together meet the overall aim of the project. Objectives do not relate to the academic processes of the module, but to the problem or area of investigation.}
