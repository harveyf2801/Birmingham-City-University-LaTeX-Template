\section{Report Introduction}
    \note{Here you will state what the report is about. This is about the literature review and methods, NOT the project as a whole. Do not begin with 'This project…' but rather, 'This report…'. Provide context, similar to the proposal rationale, in that you will say what you intend to do and why. Provide a clear structure of your report. This should not be very long and should provide a roadmap of what is included in the remainder of the report.}

    \subsection{Aim and Objectives}
        \note{Update your aim and objectives of the project with modifications generated from the feedback as provided by your supervisor. List objectives with modifications if applicable and agreed with your supervisor. Objectives should be SMART and together meet the overall aim of the project. Objectives do not relate to the academic processes of the module, but to the problem or area of investigation.}

        \subsubsection{Project Aim}	
            This project aims to provide a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of DNN methods against traditional DSP techniques for automatic phase alignment of audio signals.

        \subsubsection{Project Objectives}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item{Research and evaluate various traditional DSP techniques for auto-phase alignment.}
            \item{Design auto-phase alignment filter algorithms in Python using these DSP methods.}
            \item{Prepare a training dataset of unaligned and aligned audio for supervised learning, utilising data synthesis and augmentation.}
            \item{Develop and train a DNN model using Python, TensorFlow and DDSP to create a real-time auto-phase alignment filter which takes a reference and a single input signal to align.}
            \item{Evaluate a novel DNN model approach against existing traditional DSP algorithms.}
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Literature Search Methodology}
        \note{Provide an updated list of the search terms used in the literature review, including the various topics and themes your project covers, and library databases used.}
