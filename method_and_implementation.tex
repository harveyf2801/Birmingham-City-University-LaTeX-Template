\section{Method and Implementation}
    \note{
        This section describes the development of the artefact, including design and implementation. This should be derived from your previous design and methods report. This should be an updated version, which reflects the progress made in the implementation along with feedback from your supervisor.
        
        Remember that success of the project depends upon careful selection of appropriate method (e.g., design, model). A good method increases the validity and reliability of the outcomes. Depending on the type of project, it should cover the choice of apparatus, equipment, and software utilised. It should be possible for another researcher to repeat any experimental or research aspects of the project and expect to obtain the same data.
    
        In practice this section can be quite large and may often be broken into a number of additional sections. All details should be clearly presented. For practical, experimental and technical projects, there may be sections for calculations and analysis for parameterisation or model tuning as needed.
